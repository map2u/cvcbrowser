	<div id="sh_1.1">
	<h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
	<p>This project aims to show how improving the health of the natural environment also improves the well-being of local residents of and visitors to the watershed. With input from the local residents we will develop a set of indicators and a map tool to effectively communicate these relationships. This map-based tool will be made available to the public to explore. Ultimately, it will be used in conducting scenario analyses to see how different management decisions affect the well-being of residents.This project addresses requirements of data sharing and monitoring specified in Annex 4 of the Canada-Ontario Agreement (COA). It provides a collaborative 
	mechanism among researchers at York University, and the <a href="http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/" target="_blank">Credit Valley Conservation Authority</a> (CVC) to monitor environmental management decisions in relation to the human well-being.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="sh_1.2">
	<h2>1.2 Partners</h2>
	<p>Development and maintenance of the Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being system is led by <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/bunchmj" target="_blank">Professor Martin Bunch</a> 
	out of the SpEAR lab at the <a href="http://www.fes.yorku.ca/" target="_blank">Faculty of Environmental Studies</a> at <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/">

	<h2>1.3 Software and System Design</h2>
	<p>Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being Browser is a web-distributed geographic information system (web-GIS). It is composed of: (i) Free and Open Source System (FOSS) 
	code written for the Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being project, (ii) FOSS software modules developed by others and linked together to form the overall Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being Browser
	system and (iii) a Googlemaps mashup. Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being Browser was developed using FOSS development tools. (The only component that may potentially 
	be propriety is the spatial data required to delineate watershed and subwatershed boundaries).</p>

	<h2>2.4 Map Viewer</h2>
	<p>The Map Viewer (#4 in <a href="#sh_fig_1">Figure 1</a>) is located immediately below the header bar in the middle of the interface, 
	between the Watersheds 
	Info panel and the Search Bar. This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)" target="_blank">googlemaps mashup</a> 
	that combines spatial data from <a href="http://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">maps.google.com</a> (Google Streets, Hybrid, Satellite and Terrain, 
	etc.) with data provided by the Cedit Valley Watershed and Well-Being system (e.g., watershed polygons, subwatershed polygons) and data entered by users (Addresses, overlays in the database). The Map Viewer provides basic geographic information system (GIS) capability to pan, zoom in, zoom out, select an entity, 
	add data, turn on (view) or turn off various data layers, and access data management. On the left side of the map viewer there are functions to draw lines and shapes and to edit layers. In the strip ranging across the top of the map viewer, you will find buttons to reset the Map Viewer window and previous and next map options. On the right hand side of this strip, there is a dropdown menu in which you can select Map Layers where you will find the OverLays you wish to make active. (Some of this functionality operates in conjunction with other interface elements of the Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being Bowser system). See

	<h2>5.1 Creating a map Layer</h2>
	<p class="bold">How to create and upload a new Layer:</p>
	<p>Create a new layer when:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>There is relevant information that can contribute to the knowledge and benefit of the general public.</li>
	<li>There is a unique and/or major feature and/or condition. <!-- described and/or drawn on a data collection sheet, although the 
	site may be very close to an existing station nearby. For example, volunteers may routinely sample and re-sample a stream 
	segment immediately downstream of a storm water culvert or pipe. --></li> 
	</ul>
	<p>To create a map layer:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Log into the Credit Valley Watershed and Well-Being system.</li>
	<li>Select “Add Spatial File” on the panel options on the right side of the map.</li>
</ul>
	<!-- <li>In the <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a>, find the location where you established the water quality monitoring station (e.g., pan 
	and zoom using the map functions, or use the <a href="#sh_4.1">Location Search</a> function on the toolbar above the 
	<a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a>).
	</li>  -->
	<p>To upload data:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Once selected, the user can upload the new layer by clicking on the "browse" button and uploading the required shapefiles (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) #1(<a href="#sh_fig_3">Figure 3</a>) </li>
	<li>Once the shapefiles have been uploaded, the projection must be selected for proper spatial representation. </li>
	<li>Once the user is satisfied that they have completed their data entry task they will click on the "upload" button in the bottom-left of the window #2(<a href="#sh_fig_3">Figure 3</a>). Alternatively, they may use the "exit" or "Cancel" button to either set the window to its original condition or exit from the data upload window.</li>

	<h2>5.2 Editing Data</h2>
	<p class="bold">How to edit a new Layer:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>When uploading data, the user may want to set visual characteristics to the map in order to display information.</li>
	<li>Select the "Upload File List" located on the option panel on the right side of the map interface.</li>
	<li>Once selected the user must click on their uploaded shapefile and select the option "Set Upload File Settings" #1.(<a href="#sh_fig_3.1">Figure 3.1</a>)</li>
	<li>With the "set Upload File Settings" selected, the user can input the thematic features and the boundary demension for defining the dataset layer. The user must first select the correct data source and data field name before making changes to the data set #2.(<a href="#sh_fig_3.1">Figure 3.1</a>)</li>
	<li>Once the user is satisfied with the results, select "Apply" to submit the changes to the dataset #3.(<a href="#sh_fig_3.1">Figure 3.1</a>) CAUTION: submitting edited data will overwrite the original dataset</li>
